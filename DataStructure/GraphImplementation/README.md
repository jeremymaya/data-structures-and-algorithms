# Code Challenge 35, 36 Graph & Breadth First Traversal

## Graph & Breadth First Traversal
*Author: Kyungrae Kim*

---

### Problem Domain
Implement a Graph with the following methods:
1. AddNode
    * Adds a new node to the graph
    * Takes in the value of that node
    * Returns the added node
2. AddEdge
    * Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph
    * Include the ability to have a “weight”
    * Takes in the two nodes to be connected by the edge
    * Both nodes should already be in the Graph
3. GetNodes
    * Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)
4. GetNeighbors
    * Returns a collection of nodes connected to the given node
    * Takes in a given node
    * Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection
5. Size
    * Returns the total number of nodes in the graph
6. BreadthFirst
    * Extend your graph object with a breadth-first traversal method that accepts a starting node.
    * Return a collection of nodes in the order they were visited. Display the collection
