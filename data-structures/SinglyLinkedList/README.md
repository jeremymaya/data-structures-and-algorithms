## Linked List

### What is Linked List?

A Linked List is a linear data structure made of a sequence of `Nodes` that are linked to each other. Each `Node` are linked together by the reference field.

```text
+-------+---+   +-------+---+   +-------+---+
| Value | *-+-->| Value | *-+-->| Value | *-+-->NULL
+-------+---+   +-------+---+   +-------+---+
    NODE            NODE           NODE
    HEAD
```

### Strength

* Allows for fast operations on the ends
* Dynamic data structure - flexible in size

### Weakness

* Costly lookup
* Not cache-friendly

### Big O

|| Worst Case |
|:-|:-:|
| Space | O(n) |
| Prepend | O(1) |
| Append | O(1) |
| Lookup | O(n) |
| Insert | O(n) |
| Delete | O(n) |

## Implementation

### Lookup

```c#
```

### Insert

```c#
```

### Delete
