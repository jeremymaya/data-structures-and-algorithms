### Problem Domain
Create a Node class with the following properties:
* Value
* LeftChild
* RightChild

Create a BinaryTree class with the following methods:
1. `PreOrder` which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately
2. `InOrder` which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately
3. `PostOrder` which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately
4. `BreadthFirst` which takes a Binary Tree as its unique input

Create a BinarySearchTree class with the following methods:
1. `Add(value)` that accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree
2. `Contains(value)` that accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once
