# Code Challenge 30 Hashtable

## Hashtable
*Author: Kyungrae Kim*

---

### Problem Domain
Implement a Hashtable with the following methods:
1. `add`: takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
2. `get`: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
3. `contains`: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
4. `hash`: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.

### Inputs and Expected Outputs
| Input | Expected Output |
| :----------- |:----------- |
