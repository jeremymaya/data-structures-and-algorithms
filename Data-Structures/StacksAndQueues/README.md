# Data Structure and Algorithm

## Stacks and Queues
*Author: Kyungrae Kim*  

---

### Problem Domain
Create a Node class with the following properties:
* Value
* Next

Create a Stack class with the following properties:
* Top

Write the following methods:
1. `Push(value)` which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the `Top` of the stack with an O(1) Time performance
2. `Pop()` that does not take any argument, removes the node from the top of the stack, and returns the node’s value
3. `Peek()` that does not take an argument and returns the value of the node located on top of the stack, without removing it from the stack
4. `IsEmpty()` that does not take an argument, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the stack is empty

Create a Queue class with the following properties:
* Front

Write the following methods:
1. `Queue(value)` which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue with an O(1) Time performance
2. `Deqeue()` that does not take any argument, removes the node from the front of the queue, and returns the node’s value
3. `Peek()` that does not take an argument and returns the value of the node located in the front of the queue, without removing it from the queue
4. `IsEmpty()` that does not take an argument, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the queue is empty
